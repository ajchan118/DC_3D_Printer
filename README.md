# ME102B
ME102B Mechatronics Design (Fall 2023) - Designed and produced the x-y mechanisms for a 3D printer, built for high speed and high accelerations. Code is for a DC Motor that follows class teachings.

Cascading_Position_Control_DC is the code used directly on our final project to control the Stepper Motors

tmc_esp32 is test code used to use an esp32 to control stepper motors through the use of the TMC2209 Motor Driver.
